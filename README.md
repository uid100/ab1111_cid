<!-------1---------2---------3---------4---------5---------6---------7-------->
California AB-1111 was passed with the goal and intent of establishing a 
consistent course numbering nomenclature for CSU and CCC college and University 
transfer pathway courses. The law requires that the numbering system be student
facing and ensure comparable courses across all community colleges have the 
same course number. Currently, this requirement can and is being met by 
leveraging the existing C-ID numbering system already and publishing this
information in the catalog description and syllabus of subject courses.

To date there are five courses within the Computer Science discipline:
 - COMP 112: Introduction to Programming Concepts and Methodologies (3.0)
 - COMP 122: Programming Concepts and Methodology I
 - COMP 132: Programming Concepts and Methodology II
 - COMP 142: Computer Architecture and Organization
 - COMP 152: Discrete Structures

These courses are currently taught at
